# 🧠 CNN vs RNN Efficiency in Down Syndrome Classification

This repository contains a deep learning experiment that compares the efficiency of *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)* and *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)* for detecting Down Syndrome based on facial images. The entire project is implemented in *Google Colab* using Python and Keras/TensorFlow frameworks.
